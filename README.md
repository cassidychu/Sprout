# Sprout

## Git Cloning Project:
1. Open your terminal
2. If you are in Desktop directory, do:

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/cassidychu/Sprout.git
```

If you already created a folder make sure it's labeled differently from Sprout so that you don't get confused later. I prefer the first way.

3. Open vs code 

```jsx
code .
```

4. In VS Code, open a new terminal but before typing anything into the terminal, make sure you're in the Sprout folder

```jsx
cd Sprout
```

5. once you're in the Sprout folder, in the terminal input:

```jsx
npm i
```
6. Run the expo project

```jsx
npx expo start
```

7. In terminal once expo is running type "w" so it opens in the web browser.
